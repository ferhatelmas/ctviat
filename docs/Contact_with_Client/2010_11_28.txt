As you may remember we signed up the contest for our software development course in Bogazici University, Istanbul. That means that we are going to finish everything in real software development methodologies and rules. Since the dates of the contest and our course sylabus appropriate to each other we will also submit our project to contest which has a deadline of 15 January 2011, I think. Unfortunately we will not compete for the special prize on formal methods because we might be very busy with our other courses and projects.
