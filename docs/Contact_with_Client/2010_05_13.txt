Dear Eray Saltik,

this is to acknowledge your registration to SCORE. We have also notified your registration to the reference person for the project you chose (i.e., Kapil Vaswani), so you can start communications with him when appropriate.

Thank you for your interest in SCORE and good luck with your interesting project!

Sincerely,
Matteo Rossi
